Changes in version 1.1.1 (2019-05-20)
+ Added method to sample an infercnv object to a given number of cells, or at a given frequency, per annotation group. This is to make it easy to plot figures where all annotations groups have the same overall height, as well as downsample very large datasets that would otherwise take too long to plot (while still running the analysis on the full data)
+ Added method to plot each annotation group to a different figure and combine with sampling. Mostly intended to split data for larger datasets.
+ Added support for output_format option within run() to link to plot_cnv() to support only writting text outputs during the analysis.
Changes in version 1.0.3 (2019-07-05)
+ Fix missing dendrograms in text output when drawing figures.
+ Fix path to save object to when splitting references.
+ Fix file name creation when using num_ref_groups option.
+ Fix reference cells indices returned from method that splits references in num_ref_groups when references are not sorted and at the beginning of the matrix.
+ Fix to support of data.frame as input type for counts matrix.
Changes in version 1.0.2 (2019-05-21)
+ Reduce peak memory usage.
+ Fix to subclusters definition when using a sparse matrix and a non random trees method with no references.
Changes in version 1.0.1 (2019-05-20)
+ Improved when the clustering is defined for groups when running in sample mode.
+ Fixed support for NA to be understood as an output_format value to plot_cnv() in case a user only wants to generate the text outputs and not the plot.
+ Fix ordering of cells and color bars on the heatmap and text outputs when cells are not sorted in the same order in the input matrix and the annotation file.
+ Fix to (sub)cluster definition when a group only has 1 cell.
+ Fix plot_cnv() to handle observations groups with only 1 cell (that can't be hierarchically clustered), a single reference group when no references are not clusterd, and a single reference group with a single cell.
Changes in version 1.0.0 (2019-05-02)
+ Released as a BioConductor packages
Changes in version 0.99.8 (2019-04-20)
+ Fix missing labels on heatmap due to change in how axis() handles overlaps.
+ Improve auto thresholding of heatmap colors to still work when using stronger denoise settings.
+ Updated some examples to use tempfile() for output.
+ Fix duplicate piece of code that produced an error when using plot_steps.
Changes in version 0.99.0 (2019-03-15)
+ Submitted to Bioconductor
